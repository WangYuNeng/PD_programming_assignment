# PD_programming_assignment
These are programming assignment in 2019 Physical Design @ NTU offered by Prof. Yao-Wen Chang. I implement foundamental algorithms in physical design including partition, routing, and floorplanning.
- hw1, Fiduccia-Mattheyses heuristic for cell partition
- hw2, Dijkstra's shortest-path algorithm for global routing to minimize overflow
- hw3, B*-tree with fast simmulated annealing for fixed-outline chip flooplanner
